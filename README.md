# Bowling Game Kata

The Bowling Game Kata is a well known kata. This project contains a simple setup for a Java/Maven based project in master.
I will also upload different "runs" of the kata that I have participated in during education. Each will be contained in
its own branch.

If you want a good starting point for the kata you are welcome to clone master.

This code is in the public domain and free for anyone to use. I don't however take no responsibility for any damaged
done if you try to run it (not that I can possibly imagine any would be caused).

Have fun!
